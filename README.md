This project is completely free and open-source android MMORPG game, created with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).

## Lore

A God of Darkness sends knights of darkness to the surface world to conquer it, but the Royal Empire resists. The player is one of those dark knights who must explore the world, killing everyone who is not a dark knight (cooperative style) and gathering items, gaining experience, leveling up and becoming stronger.
